# SOCKET: Soft Collision Kernel EsTimator for Sparse Attention

We introduce SOCKET and provide:

- A long-context inference time algorithm that helps to score keys efficiently using soft LSH.
- We demonstrate that traditional LSH is unsuitable of ranking and scoring keys efficiently, instead this can be achieved with soft LSH.
- A comprehensive evaluationg on LongBench + RULER using Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, and Qwen3-8B
